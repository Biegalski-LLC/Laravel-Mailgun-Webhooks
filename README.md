# Laravel Mailgun Webhooks

This package, once completed, will allow you to quick and easily integrate your Laravel application with Mailgun Webhooks thus allowing you to track the outgoing email status for each individual user.

- Log when an email was delivered to a specific user
- Log when an email bounced for a specific user
- Etc...

This may be useful information you want to display to your end users. This might be useful information you want to display to a certain subset of users (Managers, Moderators, Admins, etc...).

Another optional feature will be to enable alerts. Receive an alert when an email fails or when there is a spam complaint. More to come.

## Installation Instructions

It is still Under Construction - not usable yet. Thanks for checking it out though. Check back soon for updates.

## Affiliations

I have no affiliation with Laravel or Mailgun. Both are just frequently used in projects I am involved in and this package fills a need across various projects.
